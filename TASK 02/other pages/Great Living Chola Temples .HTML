            The Brihadisvara Temple at Thanjavur is a Hindu temple dedicated to Shiva.[3][4] It is one of the largest South Indian temples and an exemplary example of fully realized Tamil architecture.[5] Built by Raja Raja Chola I between 1003 and 1010 AD. The original monuments of this 11th century temple were built around a moat. It included gopura, the main temple, its massive tower, inscriptions, frescoes and sculptures predominantly related to Shaivism, but also of Vaishnvaism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism. The temple was damaged in its history and some artwork is now missing. Additional mandapam and monuments were added in centuries that followed. The temple now stands amidst fortified walls that were added after the 16th century.[6][7]

Built out of granite, the vimanam tower above the sanctum is one of the tallest in South India.[4] The temple has a massive colonnaded prakara (corridor) and one of the largest Shiva linga in India.[4][8] It is also famed for the quality of its sculpture, as well as being the location that commissioned the brass Nataraja – Shiva as the lord of dance, in 11th century. The complex includes shrines for Nandi, Amman, Subrahmanyar, Ganesha, Sabhapati, Dakshinamurti, Chandesrvarar, Varahi and others.[9] The temple is one of the most visited tourist attractions in Tamil Nadu

        <h2 class="Outstanding">Airavatesvara Temple</h2>

        <p class="para_caves">
          The Airavatesvara Temple is in the city of Kumbakonam, South India, completed in 1166 AD.[18] It is one among a cluster of eighteen medieval era large Hindu temples in the Kumbakonam area.[19] The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It also reverentially displays Vaishnavism and Shaktism traditions of Hinduism, along with the legends associated with sixty three Nayanars – the Bhakti movement saints of Shaivism.[20][21][22]

Named after the White Elephant of Indra, this temple is a testimony to the grand temple architecture of the Cholan Empire. It is the last of the three great Cholan temples built by successive generations of kings starting from Rajaraja I. Airavateswara temple was built by Rajaraja II around 1150 AD. One of the striking features of this temple is Rajagambhira Thirumandapam - Royal Courtyard, with intricately carved pillars, long steps made of granite stones and elegant chariots drawn by horse - again hewn out of stone. You will see finer workmanship in this temple than the earlier temples. Darasuram is literally a stone's throw away from Kumbakonam.
