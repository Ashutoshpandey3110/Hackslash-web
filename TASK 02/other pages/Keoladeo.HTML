            Keoladeo National Park, or Keoladeo Ghana National Park (formerly known as the Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary), is a world-famous avifauna and wildlife sanctuary in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, India. The park hosts thousands of native, resident and migratory birds, especially during the winter season, when many different species fly to the Indian Subcontinent to escape winter's wrath further north in Eurasia. With at least 400 avian species having been noted or observed within, Keoladeo is a major tourism hub and Indian nature travel destination, both domestically and internationally. The wealth of species lures many amateur and professional birdwatchers and wildlife photographers, as well as scores of ornithologists during the hibernal season, who come to observe the migratory flocks' health, numbers and interactions with the local ecosystems.

Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary, as the Park was formerly named, was declared a protected sanctuary in 1971 and established as a national park on 10 March 1982. Due to its exceptional avian biodiversity, it has also been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site (1985)

          Keoladeo Ghana National Park was made a World Heritage Site in 1985, under critera iv. The justification provided was that the park is a "...wetland of international importance for migratory waterfowl. It is the wintering ground for the rare Siberian crane and habitat for large numbers of resident nesting birds". When the criteria were updated in 2005, the park fell under Criteria (x) which states that to be conferred the status of World Heritage, the site should "contain the most important and significant natural habitats for in-site conservation of biological diversity, including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the point of view of science or conservation".
