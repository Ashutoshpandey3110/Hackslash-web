            Ellora Caves are a multi-religious rock-cut cave complex with inscriptions dating from the period 6th century CE onwards, located in the Aurangabad District of Maharashtra, India.[1] They are also called verul caves.

There are over 100 caves at the site, all excavated from the basalt cliffs in the Charanandri Hills, 34 of which are open to public.[2]

These consist of 17 Hindu (caves 13–29), 12 Buddhist (caves 1–12) and 5 Jain (caves 30–34) caves.[3][4] Each group represents deities and mythologies prevalent in the 1st millennium CE, as well as monasteries of each respective religion.[3] They were built close to one another and illustrate the religious harmony that existed in ancient India.[5][6] Because of their exceptional architecture of ancient India, the Ellora Caves were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1983.[5]

All of the Ellora monuments were built during the Satavahana period, which constructed part of the Vedic Dynasty and much later Buddhist caves and the Jain caves, were named.[2][7]

Although the caves served as temples and a rest stop for pilgrims,[4] the site's location on an ancient South Asian trade route also made it an important commercial centre in the Deccan region.[8]

Ellora Caves are situated 29 kilometres (18 miles) north-west of Aurangabad, and about 300 kilometres (190 miles) east-northeast of Mumbai. Today, the Ellora Caves, along with the nearby Ajanta Caves, are a major tourist attraction in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra and are a protected monument under the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)

        <p class="para_caves">
          The Hindu caves were constructed during the Kalachuri period, from the mid-6th century to the end of the 8th century in two phases. Nine cave temples were excavated early in the 6th century,[22][23] followed by a further four caves (caves 17–29). Work first started , in order, on Caves 28, 27 and 19 then Caves 29 and 21, which were excavated concurrently with Caves 20 and 26. Caves 17 and 28 were the last ones to be started.[24][25]

The later caves, 14, 15 and 16, were constructed during the Rashtrakuta period, some being dated to between the 8th to 10th centuries.[26] Work first began in Caves 14 and 15 with Cave 16, the world's largest monolith,[citation needed] being the last of the three to be constructed.[24] These caves were completed in the 8th century with the support of king Krishna.
